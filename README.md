**Deep Learning Model Visualization: Exploring VGG16’s Feature Learning**<br>
Welcome to our deep dive into understanding how deep learning models, particularly VGG16, learn and classify images! This project visualizes the inner workings of VGG16 to provide insights into the feature learning process for image classification tasks. We aim to bridge the gap between the complex decision-making process of neural networks and their real-world applications by focusing on everyday objects like tigers, bees, and cars. <br>

**Project Overview**<br>
Deep learning models have achieved incredible feats in image classification, but the way they “see” and “learn” is often a black box. This project unpacks that box by employing visualization techniques to make sense of the features VGG16 learns as it processes images. Through this, we aim to connect the dots between the technical aspects of neural networks and their practical applications. <br>

**Key Techniques We Used:** <br>
	1.	Activation Maximization: We visualize what features each layer of VGG16 enhances to understand which parts of an image are most relevant to the model’s decision-making.<br>
	2.	Layer Visualization: By examining activations from early layers (which capture simple shapes like edges) to the final layers (which recognize complex objects), we explore how VGG16 builds its understanding of an image step by step.<br>
	3.	Animation of Activation Maximization: We create dynamic visualizations that illustrate how the model modifies an image to optimize classification, showing the model’s feature learning process over time. <br>

**Why This Project?**<br>
As deep learning becomes more prominent, understanding how models make decisions becomes just as important as the decisions themselves. With this project, we aim to shed light on what neural networks learn, why they make certain choices, and how their learning process evolves across different layers.
By visualizing and interpreting these processes, we hope to:<br>
	•	Gain a better grasp of VGG16’s feature extraction techniques.<br>
	•	Understand the evolution of the image representation inside the model.<br>
	•	Demonstrate how neural networks progressively refine their classification abilities. <br>

**How to Use This Repository**<br>
**Dependencies**<br>
To run the visualizations, you’ll need:<br>
	•	Python 3.x<br>
	•	TensorFlow<br>
	•	Keras<br>
	•	Matplotlib<br>
	•	NumPy <br>
You can install the required libraries using:<br>
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy <br>

**Running the Visualizations**<br>
	•	For Activation Maximization, run activation_max.py to see which image features are emphasized by different layers. <br>
	•	For Layer Visualization, use layer_vis.py to explore activations from early to late stages of the network. <br>
	•	For Animated Visualizations, run animate_activations.py to see how the model’s understanding of an image changes over time. <br> 

**Example Visualizations**<br>
We’ve provided example outputs in the examples/ folder so you can see what each technique reveals about the model’s feature learning process.
